# GPT Model Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, utilizing PyTorch. The model is designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, completion, and more.

The purpose of this Streamlit app is to understand the inputs and outputs of every component in the GPT block.

The Streamlit app is deployed at:
[https://gpt2demo-p4wbz98alxqcuhjdqvpo28.streamlit.app](https://gpt2demo-p4wbz98alxqcuhjdqvpo28.streamlit.app)
